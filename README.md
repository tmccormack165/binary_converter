# Decimal to Binary Decoder

Conversion from the decimal system to the binary system is an important task in Computer Science because all digital systems are built from binary code. For example, a practical use of this application is the translation from the assembly language to machine code.


# Usage

## Arguments:
1. argv[0] - executable file
2. argv[1] - decimal integer to convert to binary

```
g++ bin_convert.cpp -o a.out && ./a.out 10
```

**Output:** ```Binary Result: 1010```
